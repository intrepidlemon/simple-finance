Personal tooling to figure out how much I'm spending per month.

I use a free trial developer account from [Yodlee](https://developer.yodlee.com/) to access my own personal credit card data.

Environment variables to set include ISSUER_ID, and YODLEE_USER (the assigned yodlee user name). You'll also need a `key.pem` file issued by Yodlee.
